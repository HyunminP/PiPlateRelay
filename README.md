Intro:

This simple library can be referenced from NuGet, Copy the cs file direct from this program and copy into your program.

Usage:

Simple usage - this is a class with static functions.  Initlize the GPIO first by calling .Initilize();

After that, call the public API calls. They should be self explainitory. 

Calls end in Async only because there are some Task Delays. Later, the API may support a more Async API.
